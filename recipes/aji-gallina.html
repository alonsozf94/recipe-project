  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
    <li>Cook the yellow potatoes in salted water until tender when pierced with a fork.</li>
    <li>Let cool, peel, cut into quarters, and set aside.</li>
    <li>Place the bread in a small bowl and pour the 3/4 cup of evaporated milk over it to soak. Set aside.</li>
    <li>Place the chicken in a pot with the chicken stock and bring to a simmer.</li>
    <li>Cook for 10 to 15 minutes until chicken is just barely cooked through.</li>
    <li>Set chicken aside to cool, reserving the stock.</li>
    <li>Strain the stock and reserve 2 cups.</li>
    <li>Shred the cooled chicken into bite-sized pieces.</li>
    <li>Remove stems and seeds from the peppers.</li>
    <li>In a blender, process the peppers with vegetable oil. Blend until smooth.</li>
    <li>Add to a medium saucepan the vegetable oil and ají mixture. Add the garlic and onion to the pan and then cook
      until the onion is soft.</li>
    <li>Remove the mixture from the heat and let it cool.</li>
    <li>Add the soaked bread, walnuts, and Parmesan cheese to the blender and process until smooth. Add 1 to 2
      tablespoons evaporated milk, or even some of the strained chicken stock, if the mixture is not smooth.</li>
    <li>Add the cooked onion mixture into the blender and process briefly until well combined.</li>
    <li>Place the yellow mixture into a pan and add 1 1/2 cups of the reserved chicken stock. Stir together until
      combined.</li>
    <li>Bring the sauce to a low simmer. Add in the chicken and heat until warmed through, adding more chicken stock if
      the sauce is too thick.</li>
    <li>One portion of chicken goes over 1/2 cup of cooked white rice, garnished with a few quarters of yellow potatoes,
      a couple of quartered hard-boiled eggs, and black olives. Enjoy.</li>
